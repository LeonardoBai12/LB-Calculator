# LB Calculator

LB Calculator is a simple calculator app created as the first project for the Android Development course at PUC PR's Mobile Development postgraduate program. 

## Technologies

The application is built using the following technologies:

* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) for asynchronous programming.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) for managing UI-related data.
* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation) for building the UI.
* [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for dependency injection.
* [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/pt/actions/learn-github-actions) for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

## Quality Assurance

To ensure high-quality code, the following tools and processes are used before merging any pull requests:

* [Ktint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/) is used to enforce code style guidelines.
* All unit tests are run to ensure code functionality and quality.

This process helps maintain code consistency and quality throughout the project.
